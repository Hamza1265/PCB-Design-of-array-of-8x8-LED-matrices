    <p>Led and its products has captured great market cap due to sustainable and low energy displays. It is widly used in lightning, singal systems, data visulization, low level gamings etc.</p>
    <p>
      From market perspective in pakistan we see that pakistan is mainly importer. Periviously EU,US and Japan collectivly were dominated in this domain, and  now china is. </p>
    <p>Unfortunetly its domestic output in manufacturing is aporxmaetly 0, even in second stage manufactrruing ( assembly) paskitan has no part to plays on its own land. </p>
    <p>This motivation usually excites big part of  gen-z (those, who want move from Lab to market ) in pakistan. From only idea that we have zero domestic output our business model could be this. We had contacted to   local hospitals, govt. Institutions( i-e railways) and other local customers to buy from us ( made in paksitan ditital clock and other fantastic displays).</p>
    <p>But here is the problem, in this domain pakisatan’s import already dominates. Forexample, china’s digital digital clock device is already eveloved, it has better quality hardware quality, fast codes, excellent microcontrollers, and way better PCBs. It’s miltinational companies have great 
      competative stretgies. </p>

    <p>So certainly there is no room for our product until we don’t go with disruptive and problem solving appraoch. Hence considering the situation, our Business target rural primery level schools. These school are low budget and less developed. We will offer them.</p>
